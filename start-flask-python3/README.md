# Module 0 - Baseline migration sample app (Python 2, `webapp2`, `ndb`)

This repo folder is the baseline app for the App Engine migration module codelab tutorials. It is a Python 2 App Engine app that uses the `webapp2` micro web framework implementing an "MVP" guestbook app. It stores website visits as Datastore entities using the `ndb` library. The first tutorial in this migration series is the [Module 1 codelab](http://g.co/codelabs/pae-migrate-flask), so begin there.
